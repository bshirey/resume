\section{Biography}
\cvitem{}{
Mr. Brian Shirey is a Software Engineer with a long history of working in the Computer Security field. Mr. Shirey has 15 years of developing Computer Network Operations (CNO) and Vulnerability Discovery tools both commercially and for US Government agencies. His primary technical expertise is in native Win32 C and C++ development on Windows, and also has significant Windows kernel development experience.\newline\newline
Mr. Shirey is a proven leader of both technical and non-technical teams. He has successfully led teams of varying sizes ranging from solo projects to 20-person development projects. Mr. Shirey was the first employee of Security Innovations (SI) as a Software Engineer. Mr. Shirey helped grow a small team that was acquired by Raytheon in 2008 and now served as the Director/CEO of SI Government Solutions (SIGovs) and two other Raytheon acquisitions, collectively known as Raytheon Centers of Innovation (COI). As Director of COI Mr. Shirey led 320+ employees in 10 locations in 9 US States, including 275 computer security engineers and covering over \$85M per year in revenue for US Government agencies.\newline\newline
Mr. Shirey currently acts as the Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Forcepoint. In this role, Mr. Shirey is responsible for leading the Forcepoint Security Labs - a team of nearly 70 security researchers focused on securing Forcepoint's customers through intelligent and automated security investigations of customer web and email traffic, totalling billions of customer messages per year. Mr. Shirey also leads the Advanced Research Team for Forcepoint, a team dedicated to perform state-of-the-art research and develop new technologies in the security space that can become future products.
Mr. Shirey has been the lead engineer for a number of software tools and projects. These projects include a number of CNO Tools for the US Government, Vulnerability Discovery tools (fuzzers, test deployment/management, and vulnerability scanners), low-level libraries for biomedical equipment, and web-based applications.\newline\newline
In addition to his technical experience, Mr. Shirey has a strong academic background, including a Masters degree in computer science from Florida Institute of Technology (2004) that focused on the epidemiology of malicious code spread on computer networks. Prior to and during his graduate program he developed a Windows vulnerability scanner product as well as a behavior-based intrusion prevention product.\newline\newline

As Director of COI, Mr. Shirey led 320+ employees in 10 locations in 9 US States, including 275 computer security engineers and covering over \$75M per year in revenue for US Government agencies. In his previous role of CTO for Raytheon COI, Mr. Shirey was ultimately responsible for all engineering technical activities, setting technical direction for the organization, and determining how and where to spend IRAD funds. Mr. Shirey was influential in setting direction and organizational goals related to cyber security, collaborating with business area leaders across Raytheon. He directly oversaw \$8M of IRAD investment, and transitioned discriminators into customer programs and products throughout Raytheon. In this role, Mr. Shirey worked closely with business development, program management, finance, contracts, human resources, and senior leadership to ensure mission success. Mr. Shirey also started the SI Emergent Ventures Engine (SIEVE) team to rapidly identify and develop game-changing technologies in relevant OCO business areas.\newline\newline
Prior to this work, Mr. Shirey served as the project lead or senior developer for several customer-funded development projects, including Thumbprint, DT, WKSL, Shallot, KAV, Mad Hatter/Reaper, LDB, Holodeck, 5 SBIR contracts, HEAT, Instruction Interception, Grizzly, and a number of vulnerability research tools.  In these efforts, Mr. Shirey worked closely with the Prime and Sponsor through the entire software development lifecycle -- developing CONOPS, requirements clarification, initial design, implementation, and testing strategy.\newline\newline
As the Commercial Tools Development Manager for Security Innovation, Mr. Shirey designed and developed the Holodeck runtime fault injection technology product. He also defined, implemented, and refined software process and methodology throughout the organization.\newline
